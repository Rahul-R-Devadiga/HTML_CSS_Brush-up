## Welcome to [Learn HTML and CSS]([https://scrimba.com/learn/htmlandcss](https://youtu.be/a_iQb1lnAEQ?si=QlpLRi8irsoCgj7x))

I'm rebrushing the concpet of HTML and CSS with help of [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://youtu.be/a_iQb1lnAEQ?si=QlpLRi8irsoCgj7x) and solved some challenges it assigned 

Here, you can find the **SOLVED** starter files for all the challenges in the course. Download the entire repo and then navigate to the folder you need - the folders are structured just like the course. 

Happy coding!
